**UnitTesting**
This Project demonstrates basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) implemented in JavaScript.
The functionality is separated into a reusable module (mylib.js) and a main program (main.js) that uses the module. 
The project also includes unit tests written with Mocha and Chai, verifying that all arithmetic functions work correctly and that division by zero throws an error. 

**main.js**
Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) using functions imported from mylib.js.
Example for Mocha + Chai unit testing.

**mylib.test.js**
Unit tests for the mylib.js module.
Tests basic arithmetic operations (ass, subtract, multiply, divide)
And verifies that division by zero throws an error.
